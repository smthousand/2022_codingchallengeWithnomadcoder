                <p> Best Curry in Seoul and Great Value! 
                    If you are looking for a change from traditional Korean food 
                    this is the answer. Upstairs above a Paris Patisserie it is simple, 
                    clean and comfortable with polite, relaxed service from one of the owners. 
                    We had the Everest Curry World set menu which was delicious. 
                    I am not usually a big fan of Naan but their Naan was exceptional. 
                    A fantastic "home cooked" meal at a very reasonable price. 
                    Make sure you try this restaurant.

                    <p> Amazing food, prices, and service. 
                        I visited Everest Curry World for lunch on a Saturday 
                        and was extremely satisfied with my experience. 
                        I am a vegetarian and was happy to find a whole page of vegetarian dishes on their menu. 
                        Furthermore, their prices are about as good as you can get for a meal in Seoul. 
                        Entrees range from around 7,000-12,000 won. 
                        The curry was some of the best I've ever had, and the portion sizes were filling. 
                        Also the owners are a sweet Nepalese couple who talked with us for a few minutes. 
                        I can't wait to go again!
                    </p>
